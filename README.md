# MyNotepad

MyNotepad is a lightweight web-based note-taking application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations directly in the browser.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of DOM manipulation, event handling, and browser-based data persistence using the Local Storage API.
